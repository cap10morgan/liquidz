# Liquidz

> A fleshed-out configuration for [liquidprompt](https://github.com/nojhan/liquidprompt) in ZSH. Supports Mac OS X, iTerm2, & Homebrew (currently).

Liquidz does the following:
* Activates liquidprompt.
* Turns on colors in your terminal.
* Activates ZSH completions (many more are available if you install the `zsh-completions` Homebrew formula).
* Turns on ZSH corrections
* Sets the iTerm2 window and tab titles to the current working directory.

More to come! Feel free to open issues to request your favorite features. The next one I'm going to add will probably be ZSH inline command highlighting.

# Installation

* Install [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) if you haven't already.
* Install zsh and liquidprompt

    brew install zsh liquidprompt

* Setup ZSH as your default shell if you haven't already.
  * Add `/usr/local/bin/zsh` to your /etc/shells file.
  * Run `chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh`.

* Clone the Liquidz git repo to your home dir

    git clone https://github.com/cap10morgan/liquidz.git ~/.liquidz

* Add this to your ~/.zshrc file:

    if [ -f ${HOME}/.liquidz/init.zsh ]; then
      . ${HOME}/.liquidz/init.zsh
    fi

* Log out of your terminal and log back in.

# Usage

Currently it should *just work* if you're using Homebrew, OS X, and iTerm2. If
you want to use it in other configurations, let me know and I'll try to adapt
it. Or you can submit a pull request.

# Requirements

* Mac OS X (tested with 10.8 Mountain Lion)
* iTerm2
* Homebrew-installed ZSH and liquidprompt
